# How to run
## Docker Compose and Run Locally
To run the project, you need to run the docker containers and applications locally on your machine. You can change the compose file to create Java containers and interlink with other applications.

Attention: Observe the environment variables and the profile in which the application is running, as it can change the application's behavior.
